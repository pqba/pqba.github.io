                <p>This is far from an exhaustive list of the software I love, but I just wanted to give these three apps a little name and praise. Obsidian has been surprisingly useful after I found that the Apple Notes app wouldn't interop easily with my windows PC and it had some functionality missing and I felt that Notion was making me spend more time just creating templates and thinking about little embeds and tricks. The portability of markdown notes and local storage is fantastic. I can use the desktop, mac, iphone, and iPad app seamlessly through syncing on icloud drive. It (usually) is instantaneous and the app never feels to bloated. I've been using it for a TODO list, scattered daily notes, storage of useful articles and links, and generally as a way to effectively organize my knowledge. If you need to take notes at all and have a sort of repository of personal knowledge that's free, syncable, and private then I can't recommend it enough. <br><br>VSCode also manages to punch well above its weight unless I am doing heavy debugging of C++ code (in which case llvm+zsh is better equipped). The features that I'd want in heavier editors I use like pycharm (change all occurences, makefile integrations, etc.) seem to be missing. I guess that's the power of open source software and a plugin ecosystem, but VSCode is genuinely a must have for any type of programming project. <br><br>The last one is the Mac Preview app which I wish was available more generally. It's honestly the best pdf reader I've ever used for the smoothness, clarity, and speed alone. But the UI is also quite pretty and makes reading textbooks and even piano sheet music a breeze.</p>
